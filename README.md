SortSeer
========

This application allows you to see how different sorting algorithms work by charting each value as different size bars on the graph. Once the sorting begins, you can see the bars move around as they are sorted, until eventually all the bars are in ascending order by height.

This application allows you to control the sorting algorithm and speed. In addition, you can see the time, comparisons, and swaps used during the sort.
